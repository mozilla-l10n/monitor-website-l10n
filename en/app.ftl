## Password Tips

pwt-section-headline = Passwords = Protection
pwt-section-subhead = Your Private Information Is Only as Safe as Your Passwords
pwt-section-blurb =
  Your passwords protect more than your accounts, they protect every bit of personal information that resides in them. 
  And hackers rely on bad habits, like using the same password everywhere or using common phrases (p@ssw0rd, anyone?), 
  so that if they hack one account, they can hack many. Here are six ways to protect your accounts.

pwt-headline-1 = Use a Different Password for Every Account

pwt-headline-2 = Create Strong Passwords
pwt-summary-2 = Hackers try to steal passwords by using lists of common passwords and by guessing. The longer and more random your password is, the harder it will be to steal.

pwt-headline-3 = Treat Security Questions Like Extra Passwords

pwt-headline-4 = Use a Password Manager
